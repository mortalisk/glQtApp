The QT OpenGl sample application

Tired of using glut for your OpenGL tutorials? Want to use QT but can't figure out how to get it working. Here comes the sample application for using QGLWidget in a Qt project. It provides a skeleton wich you can then build upon or only use as inspiration.

Comes complete with .pro file

Please use as much as you like. I would appreciate if you mention my name or link to the project if you distribute it.
